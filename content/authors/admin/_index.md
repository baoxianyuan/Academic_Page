      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello! I'm Xianyuan Bao, a master student at Ningxia University.   My research is mainly based on the Yellow River Basin in China, and adopts the theory of system science to reveal the multi-process coupling mechanism and stress effect of water-sediment, ecology-economy in the Yellow River basin system, and determine the core elements and critical thresholds of the steady-state transformation of water-sediment, ecology-economy system in different regions and different development stages.
